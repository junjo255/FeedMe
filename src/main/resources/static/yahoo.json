        "content": "<p>Maybe it's fitting because Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been the biggest cheerleader of Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOGE-USD?p=DOGE-USD\">DOGE-USD</a>), but after the cryptocurrency's more than 6,000% surge so far in 2021, a $1,000 bet on Dogecoin to start the year would now be worth enough to buy a brand new Tesla Model Y.</p> \n<p>That's right.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you placed a $1,000 bet on the popular cryptocurrency, which was founded back in 2013 as a joke to lampoon the boom in the number of altcoins, you'd be sitting on more than $60,000 based on the 35 cents mark it hit Friday. In fact, at Friday's all-time high of 43 cents that same $1,000 would be worth closer to $80,000 — more than enough to cover the roughly $60,000 purchase price of a performance Model Y.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Maybe that was Musk's plan all along.</p> \n<div id=\"3e320e1b916e43698a1c3c84d8241afa\"></div> \n<p>Of course, Musk has been equally active in using his Twitter account to champion the accomplishments of Tesla. But the effort hasn't resulted in much for the company's stock, which has traded relatively flat on the year. As a comparison to the more than $50,000 that the $1,000 investment into Dogecoin would have netted, the same investment in Tesla would only amount to about $1,012.</p> \n<div id=\"638b96aa2eb54f5ead1ba9f44e4d3943\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you invested $1000 into the following on January 1, 2021, you'd have this much as of April 16:<br><br>- Tesla: $1,012<br>- GameStop: $9,060<br>- Bitcoin $2,150<br>- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dogecoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dogecoin</a>: $55,550!!! <a href=\"https://t.co/YvPN4JuPqB\">pic.twitter.com/YvPN4JuPqB</a><br><br><br><br><br></p>— Zack Guzman (@zGuz) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zGuz/status/1383029731763703814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 16, 2021</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div> \n<p>It's just another way of pointing out the incredible climb for Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@decryptmedia/what-is-dogecoin-and-should-it-be-taken-seriously-b71d7e11105f\">technically</a> has no cap on the supply of tokens in circulation. That by itself might give any crypto investor pause, given \"unlimited money printing\" by the Federal Reserve is often a main reason bitcoin fans cite for choosing it over the dollar. But Doge, which also offers cheaper transaction fees and quicker settlement times than most other cryptocurrencies, has had something else going for it long before Musk jumped on board. For years the cryptocurrency has boasted a wide and welcoming community.</p> \n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/\">r/Dogecoin Reddit group</a>, which now boasts more than 1.3 million members, philanthropic causes have been funded by community members donating Dogecoin. In 2014, for example, one anonymous member tipped the equivalent of roughly $10,000 at the time to a \"Doge4Water\" initiative meant to raise money for drinking water in Kenya. The Dogecoin community also played a role in a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265060754/wow-dogecoin-other-donors-send-jamaican-bobsled-team-to-sochi\">funding effort</a> to send Jamaica's bobsled team to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p> \n<p>But the current craze around Doge does stand out in its seemingly random spike. The crypto has advanced more than 400% this week despite the absence of an obvious catalyst. There was, of course, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-coinbase-is-a-must-own-stock-poised-to-hit-600-analyst-200546982.html\">the public debut of crypto exchange Coinbase</a>, but the platform doesn't even allow Doge for trading. Despite that, the spike had brought on a flurry of trading activity at some platforms that do list Doge, including Robinhood, which said it was dealing with \"unprecedented\" activity in the wake of Dogecoin's rally.&nbsp;</p> \n<div id=\"23ed46e4a088488ca65cb3a0ff2bd43f\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We’re currently experiencing issues with crypto trading due to unprecedented volumes and are working to resolve them as soon as possible.

The Dallas Mavericks started accepting it from fans looking to buy merchandise online, something owner Mark Cuban was happy to continue doing given the insane rally. On Friday, he gave the update that the team had set a new 24-hour record for sales in the cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p> \n<div id=\"7503dad8665d4acbb06d1c1f771c25f4\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To kinda quote a movie \"Doge keeps going up, but our pricing at <a href=\"https://t.co/F0mbQjy21C\">https://t.co/F0mbQjy21C</a> stays the same\".

Already this year New Mexico, New Jersey, New York and Virginia have legalized weed, which if you add them to the existing legal states, means some 43% of the U.S. population now lives in states where recreational marijuana is legal, as noted by Vox in a recent story headlined \"<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/12/22371929/marijuana-legalization-new-mexico-virginia-new-york-biden\">Marijuan</a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/12/22371929/marijuana-legalization-new-mexico-virginia-new-york-biden\">a legalizati</a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/12/22371929/marijuana-legalization-new-mexico-virginia-new-york-biden\">on has won.</a>\" <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/four-more-states-could-still-legalize-marijuana-this-year-after-new-mexico-new-york-and-virginia/\">On tap this year</a> are possibly Connecticut, Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island, while others like Wisconsin and Maryland are considering it as well. The record years for states legalizing weed were 2016 and last year at four. It’s conceivable that could be doubled this year.</p> \n<p>In 2000, only one-third of Americans were in favor of legalization and as recently as a decade ago not a single state allowed for recreational marijuana use. Now two-thirds of Americans support legalization, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx\">according to Gallup,</a> an all-time high and 18 states are fully legalized, with weed-friendly bills even passing in red states.<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/12/22371929/marijuana-legalization-new-mexico-virginia-new-york-biden\"> My fave ballot factoid:</a> “In the 2020 election, the legalization initiative in swing state Arizona got nearly 300,000 more votes than either Joe Biden or Donald Trump.”</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nvfGd7ZdF9XqBWhbezMYmtc4QFVWy8m0zVy35UXkjO-d4c9QkeiPrmhgdWrO8cf9Ouwre1ZvcxMDdh9Gk9sOuGlFuYUuWeowpiVtkZYE-rETtoWfvY3Uf6aCPcC39WDenMw3xYID\" data-uuid=\"\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/world/americas/mexico-cannabis-bill.html\">Mexico is set to legalize recreational marijuana this year,</a> which is already driving down prices and <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/growers-fret-as-mexico-moves-to-legalize-marijuana/19628502/\">unsettling growers for the cartels.</a> That would leave the U.S. flanked to the north and south by two of the three only legal weed countries on the planet. (The third being Uruguay.)</p> \n<p>All this gives proof yet again to that old business maxim, change happens slowly at first and then all of a sudden. Weed’s now inexorable acceptance reminds me of what happened with same-sex marriage during the previous decade. <a href=\"https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=592919&amp;p=4182201\">Beginning around 2010, primarily blue states made same-sex marriage legal.</a> Then came a flood of states a few years later, and finally, <em>Obergefell v. Hodges,</em> the Supreme Court decision in 2015, made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states.</p> \n<p>Indeed the news is coming so fast and furious that this article will likely be sorely dated this summer. Consider what just happened in Virginia. Last week, the <a href=\"https://wset.com/news/local/marijuana-weed-pot-legalization-in-virginia-how-the-commonwealth-got-here-and-what-comes-next-lynchburg-danville-roanoke-richmond\">Commonwealth legalized recreational weed</a>, making it the first Southern state to do so. Gov. Northam said that legalization was at least in part “...to address racial disparities in our criminal justice system…” (More on that later.) Here’s the wrinkle, weed wasn’t going to be legal in Virginia until 2024, but constituents pushed and the governor fast-tracked it to July 1. So just 10 weeks from now, adult Virginians can possess or grow marijuana, though there still won’t be any sales in the state until 2024.</p> \n<div id=\"ceafbc1e307a443093fc517cc6cef843\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It's official—Virginia just approved historic legislation legalizing the simple possession of marijuana on July 1, 2021.<br><br>This is a monumental step to address racial disparities in our criminal justice system and build an equitable, inclusive future for our Commonwealth.<br><br></p>— Governor Ralph Northam (@GovernorVA) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/1379951061289553920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2021</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div> \n<p>On the Federal level, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says he will introduce a bill to decriminalize weed “soon.” Schumer says he wants to ensure that small businesses benefit and that Big Tobacco and booze companies don't come to dominate the market. It should be noted that President Biden remains opposed to full legalization. It should also be noted that so were then-Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee—until they weren’t. (It’s a politician’s prerogative to change his or her mind, right?) Many Republicans remain opposed to legalization though it certainly isn’t a hot-button issue for them. Tax revenue, without serious societal consequences, has a way of changing folks’ minds.</p> \n<p>It all boils down to this though: The reasons to legalize marijuana outweigh the reasons to keep it illegal.</p> \n<p>Let’s get out the scales.</p> \n<p><strong>Why marijuana should remain illegal:</strong> It’s addictive to some people. It’s bad for teenagers. It may be a mental health risk to some. One should not drive, operate heavy machinery or farm machinery while partaking. It can be a gateway drug. And finally the last thing America needs is another legal drug (besides alcohol) or vice (besides gambling.) All true.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it should be legal: </strong>It is less harmful than alcohol, indeed than nearly any other drug. We spend $3.6 billion each year policing marijuana, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/1114413-mj-report-rfs-rel1.pdf#77\">according to the ACLU </a>with (until recently) hundreds of thousands being arrested and incarcerated each year—to accomplish what exactly? The human toll here, particularly on people of color (see below), is incalculable. Meanwhile, legal weed creates jobs and tax dollars. And more to come: <a href=\"https://newfrontierdata.com/cannabis-insights/cannabis-taxes-generate-106-billion-create-1-million-jobs-2025/\">One study says</a> the business could create a million jobs and $106 billion in tax revenue by 2025. (Still very significant even if it’s only 50% of that.) Legal weed mostly removes criminals from the business. (Think the end of Prohibition.) And of course there are proven medical uses for marijuana.</p> \n<p>But most significantly, millions of people use marijuana regularly, for the most part without ill effects to themselves or society, and wish to continue to do so, legally. The places where weed has been legalized—from Denver to Toronto to <a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/3-years-after-legalization-uruguays-recreational-cannabis-market-tangible-success/\">Montevideo</a>—have not seen an unacceptable increase in negative effects, particularly when seen in light of all the above positives.</p> \n<p>To me it’s pretty clear, the ayes have it.</p> \n<p>The legalization process is accelerating right now for several reasons. First, governors and legislators who may have been wary are now in no position to be choosy given their COVID-weakened tax bases. (See Gov. Andrew Cuomo.) If your state isn’t legal and the next state over is, which increasingly is the case, the other state will be essentially taking your tax revenue.</p> \n<p>Second, marijuana arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations are an Exhibit A of social injustice, which has become a major priority for many politicians. A <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/news/nypd-data-people-of-color-94-percent-marijuana-arrests/\">recent study in New York City </a>for instance showed that 94% of those arrested or given summonses for marijuana last year were people of color, even though marijuana consumption is consumed equally by all. And nationally, a 2020 <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/\">American Civil Liberties Union study</a> found that Black people are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for possessing cannabis. You know how it goes: A 17-year-old white boy found with weed in his pocket in Greenwich, Conn., is sent home. A 17-year-old Black boy in the Bronx is sent to Rikers.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/072ece60-9efb-11eb-bbff-edbe3b715278\" alt=\"FILE - In this April 4, 2019 photo a cannabis worker displays fresh cannabis flower buds that have been trimmed for market in Gardena, Calif.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  ASSOCIATED PRESS\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Legalizing weed is not quite as simple as flipping a switch though. Norman Birenbaum, New York state’s Director of Cannabis Operations, says he wants to make sure legalization in the state “helps communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis prohibition.” Also some municipalities may choose to opt out of legalization, he notes. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-pot-taxes-its-bad-to-get-too-high-11618565400?mod=hp_lista_pos2\">Tax policies need to be implemented,</a> and dispensary protocols with an eye to <a href=\"https://honestmarijuana.com/what-does-weed-cost/%20https://mjbizdaily.com/retail-prices-for-recreational-marijuana-flower-rise-in-response-to-record-demand-amid-pandemic/\">pricing</a> need to be established. “Twelve to 18 months is the timeline for legal sales,'' Birenbaum says. Paradoxically in some liberal states <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/marijuana/bs-md-pol-legalizing-cannabis-2021-20210412-ct4prok4jjds3jbz5kubespez4-story.html\">like Maryland </a>there may be less of an urgency to legalize as it’s already decriminalized.</p> \n<p>Still the road to national legalization at this point is a state-by-state process. Developments at the federal level will speed up the process, but not in an instant. “A lot of people have it fixated in their mind a magical day of federal legalization and doors thrown open and cannabis thrown on shelves everywhere across America, but that’s just not how these things work,” says Bethany Gomez, managing director at Brightfield Group, a research firm focused on the cannabis industry.</p> \n<div id=\"7576933b74d645a190dc855597811bea\"></div> \n<p>“There was a big misconception when Biden won the White House and Democrats won Georgia runoffs we’d quickly have federal legalization of cannabis,” says Dan Ahrens, managing director and chief operating officer at Advisor Shares, which manages AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSOS?p=MSOS&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">MSOS</a>),<strong> </strong>an ETF made up of U.S. cannabis companies. “That’s extremely misguided. It’s going to come in pieces and it’s going to be messy because politicians have to be politicians. What everybody with knowledge feels strongly is coming is at least the SAFE Banking Act.”</p> \n<p>Until the SAFE law (which would allow legal banking by U.S. weed companies) or one like it passes, domestic weed producers are limited in terms of banking services. That has created an unusual, bifurcated set of investment options for investors. On the one hand are a handful of Canadian companies (called Canadian LPs, for licensed producers) which may be familiar to you including Canopy Growth (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CGC?p=CGC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">CGC</a>), Tilray (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY?p=TLRY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">TLRY</a>), Aurora (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACB?p=ACB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">ACB</a>) and Aphria (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APHA?p=APHA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">APHA</a>). These stocks boomed in 2019, crashed last year then rose again but are still off a good 30% from their highs of two years ago.</p> \n<p>“Canadian licensed producers over promised, overspent and were essentially widely unprofitable,” says Gomez. “The companies had to right-size their businesses, cut a lot of employees and costs. They needed to focus on fundamentals and running a business as a business should be run. That left the industry in a really great position to grow,” Gomez says, noting that consumption and sales stayed strong during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>That’s the situation with the Canadian LPs.</p> \n<p>The other group of companies, which are based in the U.S., are called MSOs (stands for multi-state operators.) MSOs are not allowed to list on major U.S. exchanges, and instead typically list on smaller exchanges in Canada and then trade in the U.S. over the counter. You may be less familiar with these names which include Curaleaf (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CURLF?p=CURLF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">CURLF</a>), Trulieve (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCNNF?p=TCNNF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">TCNNF</a>), Green Thumb (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GTBIF?p=GTBIF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">GTBIF</a>) and Cresco (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRLBF?p=CRLBF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">CRLBF</a>).</p> \n<p>That’s the MSOs.</p> \n<p>What the Canadians and MSOs have in common is that both have been, and will be, <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/more-states-consider-legalizing-recreational-use-of-marijuana-pot-stocks-are-gaining-51614716522?siteid=yhoof2\">wild and crazy.</a> “What we’ve seen over the past years in the cannabis space is that there’s a lot of volatility,” says Gomez. “You never know which company will blow up, engaging in illegal activity and get license revoked.” ETFs make sense here says Gomez.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/d326ba90-9efc-11eb-a776-4c5fea64f371\" alt=\"FILE- In this Aug. 31, 2018, file photo CBD buds of chocolate by Chronic Candy are displayed at the Big Industry Show at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

It’s become a weed investors’ parlor game to<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://stocknews.com/news/mj-msos-mj-vs-msos-which-cannabis-etf-is-a-better-buy/\">debate which one offers the better strategy</a>.</p> \n<p>Dan Ahrens explains a key part of Pure US Cannabis ETF model: “We wanted to hold some cannabis stocks directly and wanted access to U.S. multi-state operators by utilizing a counterparty that gives us total return swaps, because under federal law and under the view of a federal custody bank, we couldn’t invest directly into those particular types of stocks. In addition to that, the SEC asked us to get a legal opinion letter written that addressed cannabis and also did upfront discussion of the listing exchange, New York Stock Exchange, to be fully on board.”</p> \n<p>At some point in the future, Pure US Cannabis ETF would presumably own MSO shares directly, as Alternative Harvest ETF does with the Canadian LPs. Ditto for Alternative Harvest ETF owning MSO stocks, but not for now.</p> \n<p>Jason Wilson, cannabis research and banking expert at ETFMG, which manages the Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), explains his stance. “We don’t invest directly in MSOs,” he says. “At the time, our custodian wasn’t comfortable with holding those stocks, at least not directly. The only way we could gain exposure was through derivatives. Problem with the derivative approach is it’s calling a fork a spoon.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t think it was a prudent thing to do direct investment from an exposure perspective, regulatory perspective, risk management perspective,” he says. “Without question there’s a great opportunity in the U.S. and we do have companies that have exposure to MSO, but what the road map will be is incredibly lumpy.”</p> \n<p>Another factor here are large established companies entering the picture, like Constellation Brands, the giant wine, beer and spirits company which bought a stake in Canopy four years ago and now owns 38% of the company, (Canopy’s current CEO came from Constellation.) There’s also Big Tobacco’s Altria (a top 10 holding of MJ) which bought a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis company <a href=\"https://thecronosgroup.com/\">Cronos</a> in 2018 and has been active in developing weed product expertise and in pro-weed lobbying, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2021/02/09/tobacco-giant-altria-is-pushing-marijuana-reform-on-congress-and-state-lawmakers/?sh=7fa7accc6041\">according to Forbes.</a> (Note to Constellation and Altria, Chuck Schumer is watching you.)</p> \n<p>The creation of a brand new business always brings an interesting cast of characters, in this case some more colorful than for a typical start-up industry, given the product. (Forgive me if this is my favorite part of the story.)</p> \n<p>Celebrities have of course entered the fray, or as <a href=\"https://www.inlander.com/spokane/celebrities-are-joining-the-cannabis-business-in-droves-we-imagine-how-their-products-stand-out/Content?oid=21489604\">Inlander notes in this round up</a>: Willie Nelson “is arguably the most famous stoner on the planet — all due respect to Snoop Dogg.”</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/ac2bc330-162d-11ea-bfe7-5058ea6d9415\" alt=\"American country singer Willie Nelson takes a drag off a joint while relaxing at his home in Texas, 2000s.

The answer was not yet and it’s still not yet. But it will come. Yes, there will be weed-deniers and unfriendly jurisdictions. Legal wrangling will continue ad infinitum (think blue laws.)

Lee Zeldin (R-NY) in the 1st congressional district of New York, representing eastern Long Island.</p> \n<p>\"I’m a bit old fashioned and for all my rabble-rousing in my legal career to date, I am skeptical of utopias and weary of the unintended consequences of the promises of utopias,\" Smith told Yahoo Finance. \"That said, I fundamentally think the government needs to help the less fortunate more. The rich can take care of themselves and don’t need any more encouragement or advantages.\"</p> \n<p>Smith's platform consists of three major issues: Student loans, judicial oversight and reform, and the issues that led to a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/72799730-a06e-11eb-855d-a46a083597c3\" alt=\"Austin Smith.\" data-uuid=\"238e909b-0ec3-3948-9c90-b050d44fdd3b\">\n <figcaption>\n  Austin Smith is currently managing partner of the Smith Law Group LLP.\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Zeldin, who <a href=\"https://www.easthamptonstar.com/government/2021319/zeldin-bristles-when-pressed-2020-presidential-election\">voted to overturn</a> the certification of electoral votes on January 6, will <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leezeldin/status/1380116036859613184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1380116036859613184%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fleezeldin%2Fstatus%2F1380116036859613184\">challenge</a> New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2022.

In the October 2020 congressional race in New York's 11th district, candidates <a href=\"https://www.silive.com/politics/2020/10/millions-spent-on-island-house-race-only-a-fraction-of-nations-most-expensive-campaign-in-history.html\">raised millions </a>trying to get enough exposure to get elected. And Rep. Ocasio-Cortez famously <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/aoc-ocasio-cortez-ny-14-wins-house-democrats-2d78c2b1-d697-48fd-a081-a1edce67ebf2.html\">raised $17.2 million</a> against a GOP challenger for New York's 14th district.</p> \n<p>\"If you're going to run a competitive primary and a competitive general election,\" he said, \"you're looking at certainly being able to raise a couple million dollars.\"</p> \n<p>Petitions for the race will begin in March 2021, and primaries in June 2022.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/52dc5100-a06a-11eb-abff-33443979e170\" alt=\"President Donald Trump, right, greets Rep.

Also, in 2019, former Federal Student Aid COO Wayne Johnson, a Republican, launched a bid for the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-wayne-johnson-republican-student-loan-official-who-quit-190422211.html\">then-vacant Senate seat in Georgia</a> after resigning from his position in the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>\"It's definitely the case that student loans have become a central political issue in a way that I didn't expect just a few years ago,\" Beth Akers, resident fellow at D.C.-based centrist think tank American Enterprise Institute, told Yahoo Finance. \"There has always been unease about the program, but the proposed actions in today's discourse are at a level that is surprising to me.\"</p> \n<p>Akers noted that the debt forgiveness efforts of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senator-warren-student-loans-153037171.html\">Senator Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA)</a> has shaped the \"national agenda in the way it is today\" and that the country \"seems to have shifted surprisingly far in her direction on the issue which has allowed student loan cancellation to become the mainstream issue that it is today in the Democratic party.\"</p> \n<p>Smith said that while he was inspired by Warren's student debt policies and fellow New Yorker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \"on a personal level,\" he aligned himself more with moderates like Biden and former President Bill Clinton.</p> \n<p>Though Akers wasn't familiar with the House race for New York's 1st Congressional District, she noted that Smith's campaign was clearly \"capitalizing on an opportunity to ride the student loan angst wave that seems to be cresting.\"</p> \n<div id=\"26d043daf0a3410280ffcad6f62af77f\"></div> \n<h2><strong>'The judiciary needs an audit'</strong></h2> \n<p>Smith's first experience in politics came in 2008 when he worked full-time in fundraising for the presidential campaign of former Senator John McCain (R-AZ).</p> \n<p>Towards the end of law school at the University of Maine, he got interested in student loans and why it was <a href=\"https://money.yahoo.com/student-loans-bankruptcy-133209637.html\">so difficult to discharge</a> them in bankruptcy.</p> \n<p>While working as a lawyer in New York, Smith volunteered for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential. He became a member of the education policy group, contributing ideas about addressing student debt.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2016, Smith opened his own law firm to <a href=\"https://www.condemnedtodebt.org/2019/11/crocker-v-navient-solutions-small-win.html\">litigate</a> student loans cases. He later <a href=\"https://protectborrowers.org/not-all-student-loans-are-non-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy-and-creditors-know-this/\">wrote about</a> student loans and bankruptcy for the D.C.-based advocacy group the Student Borrower Protection Center.</p> \n<p>\"The judicial branch is the only branch left where average people can exercise the machinery of the federal government,\" Smith said, adding that judge turnover is very slow and \"the judiciary needs an audit.\"</p> \n<p>—<em>Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

So far this year, Raising Cane's says it expects to exceed traffic estimates by almost 10%, and expects to finish the year with over $2 billion in system-wide sales.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"We actually did better throughout the pandemic because of our drive-throughs, and that was good for our company and our employees, but I didn't feel good about what was going on in the industry,\" Graves told Yahoo Finance during a recent interview.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"I was watching all of these independent, family-owned restaurants either struggle or even close, so I knew I had to do something about it,\" he added.</p> \n<p>In response, Graves recruited members of his Raising Cane's team, in addition to celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Shaquille O’Neal and Nelly, to help 10 independent (and pandemic-stricken) restaurants in a new Discovery+ series titled \"Restaurant Recovery.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\" data-pullquote-url=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/c4790ee0-9efb-11eb-b6f3-484239e5cbe2\" data-pullquote-width=\"1080\" data-pullquote-height=\"1184\">\n <span class=\"quote\">\"It's sad but a lot of these restaurants are never going to come back.

That amounts to a whopping 79,438 shuttered eateries out of the 778,807 that were in operation before the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"It's sad but a lot of these restaurants are never going to come back. We're going to lose a lot of great cultural centers and character. These restaurants had a soul,\" Graves expressed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"But for the ones that are able to survive this, I feel very bullish about how the market is going to recovery. There is pent-up demand to go to these dine-in restaurants,\" he added.</p> \n<p>\"I'm already starting to see with the restaurants I've helped and in my own network around the industry, restaurant demand is huge and I think its going to come back stronger than ever,\" Graves said.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Ghost kitchens 'great way to expand' </strong></h2> \n<h2></h2> \n<p>According to a new JPM note focused on restaurant recovery, \"sales and employment in food services and drinking places fell sharply early in the pandemic [but] have been recovering since.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet, despite a recent surge in spending (<a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/video/u-march-retail-sales-9-132015772.html\">March's retail sales were up 9.8%, the most since May 2020</a>), the note added that employment in the sector has yet to fully rebound — a particular pain point in the battered restaurant space.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2020 alone, the industry lost <a href=\"https://restaurant.org/research/restaurant-statistics/restaurant-industry-facts-at-a-glance\">over 3 million employees</a>. Despite easing restrictions and increased openings, many industry workers are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/restaurants-see-diners-return-but-feel-a-labor-crunch-.html\">questioning their return</a>, leading to a tight labor crunch in prominent U.S. markets.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To continue operations with a limited staff, restaurants have pivoted to <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact\">\"ghost kitchens,\"</a> virtual eateries which operate solely to serve <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-than-just-food-door-dash-grubhub-uber-eats-adapted-to-covid-19-now-plot-next-moves-143421945.html\">delivery efforts as more consumers adopt platforms</a> like DoorDash (<a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DASH?p=DASH&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">DASH</a>), Grubhub (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRUB/\">GRUB</a>) and Uber Eats (<a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBER?p=UBER&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">UBER</a>).</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/0c9412b0-9efc-11eb-8a5b-4330de622049\" alt=\"More restaurants turn to ghost kitchens to help meet customer demands \" data-uuid=\"b6fca07f-a277-3571-a2b9-a6dc400c6162\">\n <figcaption>\n  More restaurants turn to ghost kitchens to help meet customer demands \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Mariah Tauger via Getty Images\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>\"I think ghost kitchens are a great way to expand your concept,\" said Graves. He explained that he does not view the new format as a competitor to Raising Cane's, or the more traditional brick-and-mortar food hubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, the chain has been \"looking into several different ghost kitchens,\" Graves said, adding, \"It's a great format for us to grow and [in areas where we can't have street-side locations] it's a great way for us to expand.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The restauranteur revealed he's helping Snoop Dogg with a possible ghost kitchen concept in Inglewood, California.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong><em>Alexandra is a Producer &amp; Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.

Still, the law’s critics attack it for different reasons, with some Democrats arguing that Section 230 allows tech giants to host dangerous misinformation while some conservatives contend the law allows conservative voices to be censored.</p> \n<p>The Republican members’ proposal submitted Thursday calls for, among other things, modifying 230 to strip liability protection for Big Tech if their content moderation practices discriminate against political affiliations or viewpoints, a frequent conservative talking point.</p> \n<h2>‘A First Amendment problem’</h2> \n<p>Legal scholars, however, say that tech companies have a right under the First Amendment to moderate content on their site as they see fit.</p> \n<p>“There's a First Amendment problem here with some of this stuff, and that's sort of the big issue looking at a lot of these concepts,” <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/about/staff/india-mckinney\">India McKinney</a> director of federal affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Yahoo Finance.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/4fd1f570-9fe1-11eb-adcd-dc22b705c21d\" alt=\"An art installation protest by the organization SumOfUs portrays Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as a January 6th rioter on the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. March 25, 2021.  REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst     TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\" data-uuid=\"7b875ae5-1919-31d1-80b5-44a82870fa54\">\n <figcaption>\n  An art installation protest by the organization SumOfUs portrays Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as a January 6th rioter on the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. March 25, 2021. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Jonathan Ernst / reuters\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Yet another part of the proposal would treat Big Tech services as if they were state actors, limiting liability protections to moderation of speech not protected by the First Amendment (such as fighting words, obscenity, child pornography, libel and slander, threats, and copyright violations). Such a rule could obligate or heavily pressure companies to publish all other user-generated speech, regardless of its nature. That type of requirement by the government for a private entity to speak, Goldman said, amounts to censorship.</p> \n<p>“The only way you get there is if you ignore editorial privileges that internet services have. There’s an entire First Amendment provision about the freedom of the press,” Goldman said.</p> \n<p>The Republican committee members also propose scaling back Big Tech’s First Amendment protections by categorizing their services as “places of public accommodation,” a designation traditionally used for physical businesses open to the public. Under the designation, the lawmakers said, companies could be offered liability protection only for content moderation processes that can be challenged by users, in court.</p> \n<p>“The entire notion of saying, ‘We're going to treat a publisher like a restaurant’ is so incoherent,” Goldman said. “It doesn't make any sense. They're not serving customers, they're not kicking people out.”</p> \n<h2>Open season on the internet?</h2> \n<p>Signed into law in 1996 when online communication forums were in their infancy, Section 230 was created to enable platforms to make “good faith” efforts to moderate “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">objectionable</a>” content, without facing legal liability over that content. In turn, online companies could remove problematic content from their sites, without being treated as though they made the actual statements, or made editorial decisions akin to a media publication.</p> \n<p>But the vagueness of the terms “good faith” and “objectionable” have translated into websites — and of particular concern, social media and other websites — enjoying virtually unlimited power to remove, obscure, and place warnings on user-generated content. At the same time, the law does not hold tech companies accountable for the content they fail to remove (with the exception of<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/sex-trafficking-bill-senate.html\"> content related to sex trafficking</a>).</p> \n<p>While the Constitution’s First Amendment protects the speech of these private companies, Republican lawmakers blame Section 230 for allowing Big Tech companies to moderate content too aggressively — and Democratic lawmakers say it promotes the companies not being aggressive enough.</p> \n<p>Regardless of any differing impetus for reform, Goldman sees the Republicans’ memo as a signal to the rest of Congress that it's “open season” on the internet. McKinney, on the other hand, views the proposals as a wish list that has a long way to go from policy position to legislative text, especially for a party holding a minority in both Congressional chambers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/alexis-keenan/\"><strong><em>Alexis Keenan</em></strong></a><strong><em> is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance and former litigation attorney.
